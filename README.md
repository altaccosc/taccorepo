# Tacco Repo for Tachiyomi

This is my own personal repo for the sources I make.

Thanks to [keiyoushi](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions-source)
for teaching me how to do this and for preserving the build files.

Only tested on Tachiyomi Stable 0.15.3.  
Not tested with Mihon or any other forks, so your mileage with those may vary.
